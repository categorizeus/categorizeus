Externalize handlebars templates!

Review basic post and refresh flow, we need to make this thing basically useful, so two people can have a convo on screencast. 
    ^^above is the goal state, will show some rudimentary understanding of UX, etc. 
    the biggest issue, the #1 problem is after posting a reply you don't see it on the same screen
    
Initialization Fix inside of App.java
    InputStream input = new FileInputStream("/home/ubuntu/categorizeus/core/src/main/resources/categorizeus.properties");
    I hate this initialization shit with a burning fucking passion

Hey guess what more initialization ?!
    Need to make this seemlessly work from a jar and get it deployed on S3/lambda again
    and then make the SAME codebase work with inside the jar and on the local file system
    maybe like have a series of places to search for the categorizeus.properties file?

Improved rudimentary UI stuff
    create post page
    next and previous buttons
    review search vs tag mode stuff
    
Thumbnail creation for large uploads



Review and Cleanup, descriptions for use as a compsci teaching tool
basic client implementation, rough capacity writing and metrics
    how would triggering action based on code work
    
think through the basic data model, maybe an OWL model, dunno

corpus of information beyond ngrams, spellcheck suggestions might offer some level 
of insight into phonological or morphological similarities, the basic idea is looking at related words
It's not clear if this particular data structure is all that well suited for what we want to do,
but let's get something running in it and then review, the linguistic variant stuff might
happen in one of the private code binaries and then we feed in here for demo purposes

generate ERD diagram of data model

performance testing on data model
explore idea of tags having a real valued relationship to a message (this is in the data model already)


*** include associated tags in http JSON response from the thread endpoint *** 

tune this and review it several times, setup blog host, then move on to lyrics generator thing

General Code review, blog post



bloody hell this secure shell bullshit thing about keyboard shortcutes, ctrl+w closes window fucking great
	maybe is easier to remap nano than chrome or somet shit
