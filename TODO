Externalize handlebars templates!

Review basic post and refresh flow, we need to make this thing basically useful, so two people can have a convo on screencast. 
    ^^above is the goal state, will show some rudimentary understanding of UX, etc. 
    the biggest issue, the #1 problem is after posting a reply you don't see it on the same screen
    
Initialization Fix inside of App.java
    InputStream input = new FileInputStream("/home/ubuntu/categorizeus/core/src/main/resources/categorizeus.properties");
    I hate this initialization shit with a burning fucking passion

Hey guess what more initialization ?!
    Need to make this seemlessly work from a jar and get it deployed on S3/lambda again
    and then make the SAME codebase work with inside the jar and on the local file system
    maybe like have a series of places to search for the categorizeus.properties file?

Improved rudimentary UI stuff
    create post page
    next and previous buttons
    review search vs tag mode stuff
    
Thumbnail creation for large uploads



Review and Cleanup, descriptions for use as a compsci teaching tool
basic client implementation, rough capacity writing and metrics
    how would triggering action based on code work
    
think through the basic data model, maybe an OWL model, dunno


tune this and review it several times, setup blog host, then move on to lyrics generator thing

General Code review, blog post



bloody hell this secure shell bullshit thing about keyboard shortcutes, ctrl+w closes window fucking great
	maybe is easier to remap nano than chrome or somet shit
