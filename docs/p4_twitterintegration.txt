    A lot of interesting things can come from short snippets of text, 
as anybody with a texting partner knows. So, we're going to use twitter for our
first cut of authentication. Coincidentally, my first prototype also used twitter
so I know these APIs pretty well, so let's get started. 

    First, I would suggest you create multiple throwaway twitter accounts for this.
In my initial prototype, I ended up running one of the NLP apps on my main
account. The result was ugly, so please don't do that. (Aside: some of my
friends failed the Turing test, maybe you need a Turing Test Test lol)

You want to have at least two accounts, one to run the application and one to 
login to make sure that it works. 

1. Visit apps.twitter.com and create a new app for testing
This is your test application, so you're not posting to all your friends,
am I right?

2. Create a new file in the current directory for categorize.us called
twitter4j.properties, it should look like this:
debug=true
oauth.consumerKey=*********************
oauth.consumerSecret=******************************************
oauth.accessToken=**************************************************
oauth.accessTokenSecret=******************************************

3. Click keys and access tokens on apps.twitter.com you will find two sections
one for the consumer Key and Secret, one for the access token and secret for 
your user. 

Paste these values into twitter4j.properties

4. Now, we will run a simple, standalone test class to verify that we have
access, all the files are in the right place and the right location etc. 
If you have problems with this step, please create an Issue here:

So that I can address your problem, this all works for me. If I find common
errors, I will eventually add them to the wiki.
