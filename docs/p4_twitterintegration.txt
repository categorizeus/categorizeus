    A lot of interesting things can come from short snippets of text, 
as anybody with a texting partner knows. So, we're going to use twitter for our
first cut of authentication. Coincidentally, my first prototype also used twitter
so I know these APIs pretty well, so let's get started. 

    First, I would suggest you create multiple throwaway twitter accounts for this.
In my initial prototype, I ended up running one of the NLP apps on my main
account. The result was ugly, so please don't do that. (Aside: some of my
friends failed the Turing test, maybe you need a Turing Test Test lol)

You want to have at least two accounts, one to run the application and one to 
login to make sure that it works.
