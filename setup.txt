developing using google chromebook

	I'm using a samsung series 3
	reboot into developer mode by pressing esc,refresh,power at the splash hit ctrl+D
	this will turn the computer into developer mode

setup github.com for github.com/categorizeus/categorizeus
sign up for AWS free tier
launch a free tier micro instance of ubuntu, save key to local box - probably should back it up somewhere for good measure
press ctrl+alt+t go into the cors window, type shell to get into a bash shell
notice there is only vi, hit head against table several times
reluctantly use vi or use cat to save hostname into a file
do chmod 400 blah.pem and ssh -i blah.pem whatever.host
ssh into ubuntu box

--- at this point we're into a development box ---

install git, should be already done
follow the git instructions - run ssh-keygen, add the key to github, do ssh git@github.com should see that you are logged in
make a small commit to verify connection, this would be for example
git clone <your repo>
cd categorizeus
nano setup.txt
type some stuff
git commit -a -m "hello from the other side"
git push origin master

if you're like me you forgot to do this:
    git config --global --edit

After doing this, you may fix the identity used for this commit with:

    git commit --amend --reset-author


--- get coffee and meditate to gather strength for the tedium ---

1) Install java, preferably sun java, 8 or higher
	1a) Check which version of ubuntu you're running, lsb_release -a
	should look something like this
	No LSB modules are available.
	Distributor ID: Ubuntu
	Description:    Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS
	Release:        16.04
	Codename:       xenial
	1b) check that there are not some idiotic hoops to jump through to install java on your version
	1c) I've had good luck with the webupd8team for java installs, so I ran this
		sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
		sudo apt-get update
		sudo apt install oracle-java8-installer
		accept the oracle license, silently curse oracle for their lack of compliance with linux
		ubuntu@redacted:~/categorizeus$ java -version
		java version "1.8.0_131"
		Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_131-b11)
		Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.131-b11, mixed mode)
		ubuntu@redacted:~/categorizeus$ 
		if this command looks like something like this ^^^ then you've got your language installed
install maven3
