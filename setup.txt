developing using google chromebook

	I'm using a samsung series 3
	reboot into developer mode by pressing esc,refresh,power at the splash hit ctrl+D
	this will turn the computer into developer mode

setup github.com for github.com/categorizeus/categorizeus
sign up for AWS free tier
launch a free tier micro instance of ubuntu, save key to local box - probably should back it up somewhere for good measure
press ctrl+alt+t go into the cors window, type shell to get into a bash shell
notice there is only vi, hit head against table several times
reluctantly use vi or use cat to save hostname into a file
do chmod 400 blah.pem and ssh -i blah.pem whatever.host
ssh into ubuntu box

--- at this point we're into a development box ---

install git, should be already done
follow the git instructions - run ssh-keygen, add the key to github, do ssh git@github.com should see that you are logged in
make a small commit to verify connection, this would be for example
git clone <your repo>
cd categorizeus
nano setup.txt
type some stuff
git commit -a -m "hello from the other side"
git push origin master

if you're like me you forgot to do this:
    git config --global --edit

After doing this, you may fix the identity used for this commit with:

    git commit --amend --reset-author


install maven3
